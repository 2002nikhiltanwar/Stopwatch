# Stopwatch
A ~~ugly~~ simple **Stopwatch** app made in *Python with Tkinter*

### Requirements
* Python 3x
* A command line interface

### Getting Started
Just type the following in a CLI -
```python stopwatch.py```

**Note** - You *should* be in the same folder/directory containing the Python file.

My first attempt in GUI ^\_^
